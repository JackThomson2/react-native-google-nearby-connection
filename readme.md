# react-native-google-nearby-connection
React Native wrapper for Googles [Nearby Connection API](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview)

# Install

## Install package

```bash
npm i react-native-google-nearby-connection --save
```

### Android

- Make sure you are using Gradle `2.2.x` (project build.gradle)
- Add google-services

```gradle
buildscript {
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3'
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.1.2'
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

- Add the following to your `build.gradle`'s repositories section. (project build.gradle)

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://maven.google.com" }
        ...
    }
}
```

### app:build.gradle

Add project under `dependencies`

```
android {
    ...
    compileSdkVersion 26
    buildToolsVersion "26.0.1"
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 26
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
        ...
    }
...
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-nearby:11.8.0'
    compile project(':react-native-google-nearby-connection')
    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.3.1'
    compile 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.1'
    ...
}
```

### settings.gradle

Include project, so gradle knows where to find the project

```
include ':react-native-google-nearby-connection'
project(':react-native-google-nearby-connection').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-google-nearby-connection/android')
```


### MainApplication.java

We need to register our package

Add `import com.butchmarshall.reactnative.google.nearby.connection.NearbyConnectionPackage;` as an import statement and
`new NearbyConnectionPackage()` in `getPackages()`


# Usage

Import library

```javascript
import NearbyConnection, {ConnectionsStatusCodes, Strategy, Payload, PayloadTransferUpdate} from 'react-native-google-nearby-connection';

    endpointName,           // This nodes endpoint name
    serviceId,              // A unique identifier for the service
    strategy                // The Strategy to be used when discovering or advertising to Nearby devices [See Strategy](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/nearby/connection/Strategy)
);
```
